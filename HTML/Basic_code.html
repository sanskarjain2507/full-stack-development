        <h2 align="center">CLOUD COMPUTING</h2>
        

<p>During the last few years, cloud computing
        has become a <b>buzzword on the internet.</b> 
        In simple terms, it is the process of delivering 
        services hosted on remote data centers 
        connected through the internet.

Cloud computing means that instead 
        of all the computer hardware and 
        software you're using sitting on 
        your desktop, or somewhere inside your
        company's network, it's provided for 
        you as a service by another company 
        and accessed over the Internet, usually
        in a completely seamless way.</p>

<p>Exactly where the hardware and software
        is located and how it all works doesn't
        matter to you, the userâ€”it's just 
        somewhere up in the nebulous "cloud"
        that the Internet represents.
     <i>   For example of cloud computing.
        Simply log on to a web-based service 
        such as Google Documents and you 
        can create a document, spreadsheet, 
        presentation, or whatever you like 
        using Web-based software.</i>
    
One basic principle of cloud computing
        is that you no longer need to worry
        how the service you're buying is 
        provided.It's "on-demand"Cloud
        services are available on-demand
        and often bought on a "pay-as-you go"
        or subscription basis. So you typically
        buy cloud computing the same way 
        you'd buy electricity, telephone services, 
        or Internet access from a utility 
        company. </p>

<dt><u>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</u></dt>
      <dd> It means you're buying access to raw
          computing hardware over the Net,
          such as servers or storage.</dd><br>
<dt><u>Software as a Service (SaaS)</u></dt> <dd> It mean you

<dt><u>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</u> </dt><dd> Itmeans 
        you develop applications using
        Web-based tools so they run on
